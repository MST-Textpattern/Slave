SLAVE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Install latest version of Textpattern as per instructions. Check it's all working well. Login to the Admin interface and do these few things before importing the Slave theme, so it all goes smoothly when you do.

1 Admin: Change custom field 1 to Subhead

2 Categories: Cat, Jaguar, Leopard, Lion, Lynx, Tiger will use colours set at the end of the stylesheet. Or use your own and change stylesheet accordingly.

3 Images: please upload these images in order, so styles and forms can find them. 1seamless to ID 1, 2headerpic to ID 2 etc, 3atom, 4divider, 5small, 6big. There's 2 favicon images too which go in the root of your site. It's good practice to have favicons.

4 Plugins: open "wet_haystack" and copy/paste it onto the Plugins field, install and enable. It is not essential but allows the site search to find things in Categories, Excerpts and custom fields, if you choose those options. Once it is setup you can make it inactive and those fields are still searched.

5 Content: open Welcome To Your Site and copy "What do you want to do next?" from the Body to the Subhead custom field. Delete it from the body. Body Format - "Use Textile". Excerpt Format - "Leave text untouched". (Always use this setting for Excerpt). Set the Article image to 6. Save.

7 Stylesheet: upload the CSS folder to your site (alongside the files, textpattern and other folders). This contains fonts and slave.css and this stylesheet is the one in use, athough after import you'll find a copy in Styles called default.

8 Slave theme: upload the Slave folder into the Themes folder on your site.

AND NOW IMPORT THE THEME

9 Presentation - Themes: Import the Slave theme. Click "Assign sections", change Theme to Slave for both sections, return to Themes and you should see it say "In use". Now you can visit Pages, Forms or Styles, and you should see also Slave indicated as the theme in use. If all is as it should be, click Slave Theme (on the menu bar next to Admin) and see your new theme with the default article excerpt and links to see the full article.

10 Further content: Article#2 is special. It uses the "home_sticky" form to put a short teaser below the latest article excerpt. Please copy/paste article#2 so you can see how it works. And to reinforce your understanding of this simple theme, please copy/paste article#3 as well. You can alter all articles as you like but it's a good idea to go through the motions and use the Write panel with this ready made content first.

11 Colours: The Slave theme is not very jolly but you can easily alter that. All the colours used are grouped together at the end of the stylesheet, apart from the Form and the Buttons sections. So you can quickly see what applies to what and make your site much more beautiful. Enjoy!
