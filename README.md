# Slave
Slave theme for Textpattern CMS

A simple blog for Textpattern CMS that cannot unknowingly produce duplicate content. Duplicate content is easily produced by a CMS when a list of files or excerpts are created by a section list, author list, category list, search list etc. Although Canonical URLs are used to tell search engines which page to index, I suspect these are sometimes ignored and a site is downgraded in ranking.
